#  A certain childrens game involves starting with a word in a particular category. Each participant in turn says
# a word, but that word must begin with the final letter of the previous word. Once a word has been given, it
# cannot be repeated. If an opponent cannot give a word in the category, they fall out of the game. For
# example, with "animals" as the category.
